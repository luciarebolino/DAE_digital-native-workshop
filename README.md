# 🌐 DIGITAL NATIVE WORKSHOP  
### Scraping Street View  
  
**Tools:** Google Street View API, Node.js, FFmpeg, QGIS  

The workshop positions **code as camera** — exploring how digital infrastructures and APIs encode geography and movement to **reconstruct digital landscapes** as narrative and critical media.

---

## Overview

*Scraping Street View* explores how to use open web infrastructures as creative and investigative tools.  
Through this workshop, participants will learn how to use the **Google Street View API** to programmatically capture sequences of images from specific locations — transforming them into short, coded video essays.

The workshop combines **scripting, mapping, and visual storytelling** to reframe familiar platforms such as Google Maps and Street View as open datasets for artistic exploration.

Participants will learn to:
- Access and use the Google Street View API
- Extract geolocated imagery from chosen routes or locations
- Visualize and manipulate spatial data in **QGIS**
- Generate camera movements through code
- Convert image sequences into short videos using **FFmpeg**

By the end, each participant will be able to “film” a short, coded documentary — using only open-access material and scripting as the camera.

## Requirements

- Basic familiarity with JavaScript (or curiosity to learn)
- A laptop with macOS, Windows, or Linux
- Installed dependencies: `Node.js`, `npm`, `FFmpeg`, `QGIS` (we will see how to install them at the beginning of workshop)
- A GitHub account for forking the workshop repository
- A Google account (for API key setup and My Maps) - **for the purpose of this exercise you will use my API key, but I show you how to set up one for the future
